# AI-Based Cloud Resource Auto-Scheduler

## Overview
The **AI-Based Cloud Resource Auto-Scheduler** is an intelligent system that automatically scales cloud resources up or down based on predicted demand. Using AI-driven algorithms, it analyzes historical data and real-time user activity to make precise predictions, ensuring optimal resource allocation and minimizing costs and idle time.

This project enables businesses to efficiently manage their cloud infrastructure, prevent resource over-provisioning or under-provisioning, and save on cloud costs through dynamic, automated scaling.

## Features
- **Demand Prediction**: Predicts cloud resource demand using AI models based on historical and real-time user data.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically adjusts cloud resources to meet predicted demand.
- **Cost Optimization**: Minimizes cloud infrastructure costs by preventing unnecessary resource allocation.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks system performance and adjusts scaling in real time.
- **Cloud Provider Integration**: Supports integration with major cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

## Architecture
The system is composed of the following key components:
- **Data Collector**: Gathers historical usage data and real-time user activity.
- **AI Prediction Engine**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., time-series forecasting, reinforcement learning) to predict future resource needs.
- **Cloud Resource Manager**: Interfaces with cloud providers to automatically scale resources.
- **Monitoring Module**: Tracks system performance and provides feedback for improving prediction accuracy.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Cloud account with AWS, GCP, or Azure (with autoscaling enabled)
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch for AI model
  - Boto3 (for AWS) or equivalent for cloud integration
  - Flask (for web interface, optional)
  - Pandas, NumPy (for data processing)
  
## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-cloud-auto-scheduler.git
    cd ai-cloud-auto-scheduler
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure cloud provider credentials**:
   - For AWS: Set up your AWS credentials in `~/.aws/credentials`.
   - For GCP/Azure: Follow the respective setup guides to integrate API keys.

4. **Run the project**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
1. **Collect Data**: Ensure that historical usage data and real-time user activity are being fed into the system.
2. **Train Model**: Use the provided script to train the AI model on historical data:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
3. **Auto-Scaling**: Deploy the auto-scaling service and let it handle resource management based on AI predictions.
**Configuration**
- Scaling thresholds: Define thresholds for resource scaling in config.yaml.
- Cloud Provider API: Update API configurations in the config.yaml file based on your cloud provider.
  
**Future Improvements**
- Support for multi-cloud integration (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- Enhanced prediction models incorporating additional metrics like network traffic and storage demand.
- Predictive maintenance to auto-detect resource failures.
